# Connect Beta
Connect is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) economy bot for [Discord Hackweek 2019](https://blog.discordapp.com/discord-community-hack-week-build-and-create-alongside-us-6b2a7b7bba33)! Based mostly on image generation, this bot has fun features, and lets you customize a profile using the experience you earn!

This bot uses Canvas, a npm.js package to create custom images for profiles!

## Invite & Test
**[Invite The Bot](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=591893713005838336&permissions=379969&scope=bot)**

## What I Learned
Connect was an awesome bot to work on! I learned a lot about image generation with the [Canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) package, and how to make cool looking image-based profiles. I will use this knowlege to enhance my future projects!
